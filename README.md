# Intro_to_machine_learning_with_TensorFlow_Udacity
Projects in Udacity nanodegree course Introduction to machine learning with TensorFlow.

In this Nanodegree, I've learnt foundational machine learning algorithms, starting with data cleaning and supervised models. Then, move on to exploring deep and unsupervised learning. At each step, I got practical experience by applying the learnt skills to code exercises and projects.

Here, I uploaded the three projects I've done in this Nanodegree:

1. Supervised learning project: Finding donors for CharityML
In this project, I employed several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I then chose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features.
The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid". The article by Ron Kohavi can be found online. The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the 'fnlwgt' feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.

2. Unsupervised learning project: Identify customers segments
In this project, I appled unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data has been provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

3. Deep learning project: Image classifier 
In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. Something like this in a phone app can tell you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. I trained the image classifier, then export it for use in an application. I used dataset from Oxford of 102 flower categories.
